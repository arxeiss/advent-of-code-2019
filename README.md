# Advent of Code 2019 in Elixir

In the new job, I'm working in Elixir. But I had no previous experience with it. This is my first real code in Elixir as I'm learning with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

See each day for more information. I copied the instructions there as well.

> **Why it is not complete?** I started with AoC as a "learning guide" to Elixir. But working on a company project is the main goal. Maybe I will continue in the future.
